<p>I’ve been training people in this system for the last few years — first in one-on-one coaching, workshops and retreats, and more recently in my&nbsp;<a href="https://fearless.zenhabits.net/">Fearless Training Program</a>&nbsp;where hundreds of people have trained and seen incredible results.</p>



<p>This is a proven system that has helped people overcome patterns that have held them back for years. They’ve gone on to:</p>



<ul><li>Write books</li><li>Start their business</li><li>Play music in public</li><li>Do public speaking</li><li>Create art</li><li>Tackle their finances</li><li>Find focus and a sense of peace</li><li>Deal with anxiety</li><li>And much more</li></ul>



<p>How much would it be worth for you to overcome old patterns of putting things off, avoiding, or getting paralyzed by anxiety? The training package, including the ebook, videos and meditations, is just $33. It’s worth a thousand times that, in my view, if you put it into action.</p>
